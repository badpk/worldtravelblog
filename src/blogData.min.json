The bus journey takes about 8 hours, including border crossing. It was rather uneventful except at the Cambodia visa office the officials tried to charge us the official $20 visa fee plus an extra 100 baht (about $3). Posted on window was a rather unprofessional handwritten sign stating: Visa USD $20 + 100 baht. Having done our research already we knew this was a scam, so Peter simply shoved our paperwork plus $20 at them and repeated &ldquo;No, twenty dollars only!&rdquo; about 3 times and they took it without issue.<br/><br/>A few observations on Siem Reap. It&rsquo;s tourist land. Cambodia is a very poor country and you can see it from the bus. You can see farms and fields and people living rural lives. The roads are dirt and buildings utilitarian. There is more trash on the side of the road than in Thailand (though less than India.) But once you pull up in Siem Reap there are neon lights, paved roads, and beautiful hotels. Siem Reap offers everything you expect from over-touristed places: souvenir shops, cheap massages, fish pedicures, happy hour deals, and pizza restaurants. Overly friendly and aggressive people selling stuff to you on the street from tuk tuk rides to drugs. The locals speak English alarmingly well (and Mandarin too.) Rowdy tourists from all over the world spill into the streets: Australians, Europeans, Russians, the hordes of Chinese, and Koreans. It can be fun if you set your expectations accordingly. Don&rsquo;t expect the authentic Cambodian experience in Siem Reap, just go have a $1.50 margarita and enjoy the ridiculous &ldquo;spring break&rdquo; atmosphere.</p>"},{"id":73950048205,"type":"photo","date":1390230900000.0,"tags":["siem reap","cambodia","cooking class"],"zoom":5,"location":"Siem Reap, Cambodia","photos":[{"src":"/images/73950048205_0.jpg","width":1280,"height":956},{"src":"/images/73950048205_1.jpg","width":1280,"height":956},{"src":"/images/73950048205_2.jpg","width":1280,"height":956},{"src":"/images/73950048205_3.jpg","width":1280,"height":956},{"src":"/images/73950048205_4.jpg","width":1280,"height":956},{"src":"/images/73950048205_5.jpg","width":1280,"height":956}],"slug":"cambodian-cooking-class-although-we-usually-dont","body":"<p><strong>Cambodian Cooking Class</strong></p>\n<p>Although we usually don&rsquo;t drop names in our blog, I am going to mention the cooking class I took in Siem Reap.

The slum generates hundreds of millions of dollars a year from various industries located within such as recycling and manufacturing. We visited several recycling centers for plastics, aluminum, and paint cans. Next we made our way through the residential alleys, some barely 3 feet wide, trying to catch a glimpse into family homes. Most of the homes have only 1 room and do not have plumbing so most of the 1 million residents use one of the 700 public washrooms available - you do the math. Our tour guide told us that the people are happy living there and wouldn&rsquo;t move out if given the opportunity. There are even some millionaires (in rupees) that choose to call the slum home. The people have a deep sense of community and consequently there is a very low crime rate.</p>\n<p>In addition to slum visits, Reality Tours runs a community center in the slum and 80% of the tour fee goes to fund it.

The guide was friendly and explained the story of Brahma and temple. Then he led us to the lakeside to see the Brahmin priests for a prayer and blessing. He explained that people give donations for the charity and the temple, but we would not be pressured; donations should come from the heart. No pressure, we were assured.<br/><br/>Peter and I were separated to individual priests. So I sat with mine and we had a repeat-after-me session of holy chants. He asked about my family members and we chanted prayers for them.<br/><br/>Then he got to the sell. &ldquo;How much do you want to donate?&rdquo; he asked outright. &ldquo;No pressure. Some people give 1000 rupees, 5000 rupees, some give 10,000 rupees. Americans give American dollars, 50 dollars, 100 dollar&hellip;.. Give from your heart, for good blessing for your family. Tell me how much will you donate?&rdquo;<br/><br/>At this point he&rsquo;s totally pressuring which I really hate, so I said &ldquo;10 rupees.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The priest did not even try to hide his displeasure. He the repeated the whole &ldquo;some people give 1000 rupees&hellip; Americans give 50 dollars&rdquo; spiel. &ldquo;I am not pressuring you. Please give from the heart. So how much you want to give?&rdquo;<br/><br/>I said I only had 10 rupees with me because my husband is carrying the money. He then said it was okay to get more money from my husband and I could match whatever donation he made. Okay, I promised to match my husband&rsquo;s donation.<br/><br/>So when Peter&rsquo;s priest was finished, we were reunited and he asked for a donation, holding out his metal platter. Both priests and the guide were staring us down hard and Peter pulled out 20 rupees! That really angered them, and they even refused to take the 20 rupees.<br/><br/>The whole experience left us confused and angry. What the hell just happened? Did we offend someone? Not likely, they offended us first by putting on the pressure, we rationalized. It was only later we saw online that this is a normal scam in Puskhar. Just search for &ldquo;Pushkar scam!&rdquo; 10,000 rupees my ass!<br/><br/>The funny thing was that even though separated, Peter and I were of the same mind. I&rsquo;ll give you 10 rupees haha. Actually we are reading online that 10 rupees is fine for a &ldquo;puja&rdquo; ritual in India, as it&rsquo;s just a token for a blessing.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s such a shame because Pushkar is a nice little town with an awesome camel fair, only to be ruined by predatory holy men who only want to scam westerners. It really puts up barriers to travelers who want to experience Indian culture and is a shame on India. I wonder why the government doesn&rsquo;t crack down on this shameful behavior?

And remember to keep left on the walkways - you can blame the British for that.</p>"},{"id":66784558723,"type":"photo","date":1384273239000.0,"tags":["jama masjid mosque","fatepur sikri","india"],"zoom":5,"location":"Fatepur Sikri, India","photos":[{"src":"/images/66784558723_0.jpg","caption":"Jama Masjid Mosque","width":720,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/66784558723_1.jpg","caption":"Fatepur Sikri","width":720,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/66784558723_2.jpg","caption":"Jama Masjid Mosque","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/66784558723_3.jpg","caption":"Fatepur Sikri","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/66784558723_4.jpg","caption":"Fatepur Sikri","width":720,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/66784558723_5.jpg","caption":"Fatepur Sikri","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/66784558723_6.jpg","caption":"Jama Masjid Mosque","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/66784558723_7.jpg","caption":"Jama Masjid Mosque","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/66784558723_8.jpg","caption":"Jama Masjid Mosque","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/66784558723_9.jpg","caption":"Fatepur Sikri","width":1280,"height":720}],"slug":"fatepur-sikri-and-jama-masjid-mosque-akbar-moved","body":"<p><strong>Fatepur Sikri andÂ </strong><strong>Jama Masjid Mosque</strong></p>\n<p>Akbar moved the capital of his empire from Agra Fort to the site just 23 miles away from 1571 to 1585 in honor of the Sufi saint Salim Chisti.

We decided to visit the Jama Masjid, a mosque in old Delhi listed on many a &ldquo;things to do in Delhi&rdquo; website. It appeared to be a short subway ride, just 2 stops from New Delhi Metro station, and at a fare of 8 rupees we thought it would be a great little trip. However we never made it to the Metro platform.</p>\n<p>New Delhi station was crowded. Like a turbulent sea of wall-to-wall bodies swarming and pushing. What did we expect? We dove in eager to test our swarming skills. It took quite some time and effort to descend into the station and we actually reached the token counter, but by then we realized how would it take to actually board a train? Maybe walking would be quicker. We were wrong!</p>\n<p>The streets of Delhi are insane. Crazy like you might have seen on TV: rickshaws, motorbikes, carts, cars, cows, crap, and people. People coming out of every orifice of the city. People begging, people selling crap, people yelling &ldquo;hello! Hello madam! Hello China! Japanese? Hello hello!&rdquo; Everyone trying to engage you to sell an expensive tour, trinket, or taxi ride. And honking. The honking is legendary, but Lima has deadened our ears to that already. Feeling lost and realizing it was farther than we had thought, we hailed a bicycle rickshaw. For less than a dollar we could watch the street unfold around us without the fear of getting run over.Â </p>\n<p>At Jama Masjid, some official-looking men tried to charge us 300 rupees to take pictures. We had read about this scheme online so despite their insistence we refused to pay, saying we would not take pictures. They said no cameras or mobile phones were allowed inside, which is crap, as we could see plenty of Indians using their devices. We had to get very assertive. Then they tried to charge me 50 rupees a coverup gown &ldquo;for modesty.&rdquo; We called them out on their crap as I happened to be more covered up than most of the local women! We stood our ground and finally we got to visit without the ridiculous extra charges. And screw it, we took pictures anyway, as the locals were doing. While inside we noticed every foreign woman in coverup gowns regardless of what they were wearing underneath. What a racket! (FYI, no need to cover my hair, just look at what the locals are doing and follow suit.)</p>\n<p>While we make it sound like we handled it like pros, in reality it was a learning experience for us. We came out ahead financially but it left us drained emotionally. We knew India would not be easy, but how difficult we are only beginning to comprehend.Â </p>"},{"id":65880178832,"type":"photo","date":1383478242000.0,"tags":["buenos aires","argentina","graffiti","street art"],"zoom":5,"location":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","photos":[{"src":"/images/65880178832_0.jpg","width":720,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/65880178832_1.jpg","width":720,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/65880178832_2.jpg","width":720,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/65880178832_3.jpg","width":960,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/65880178832_4.jpg","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/65880178832_5.jpg","width":720,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/65880178832_6.jpg","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/65880178832_7.jpg","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/65880178832_8.jpg","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/65880178832_9.jpg","width":960,"height":1280}],"slug":"street-art-part-2","body":"<p><strong>Street Art - Part 2</strong></p>"},{"id":65777139722,"type":"photo","date":1383391848000.0,"tags":["buenos aires","argentina","graffiti","street art"],"zoom":5,"location":"Buenos Aires, Argentina","photos":[{"src":"/images/65777139722_0.jpg","width":960,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/65777139722_1.jpg","width":720,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/65777139722_2.jpg","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/65777139722_3.jpg","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/65777139722_4.jpg","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/65777139722_5.jpg","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/65777139722_6.jpg","width":960,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/65777139722_7.jpg","width":1280,"height":960},{"src":"/images/65777139722_8.jpg","width":1280,"height":720},{"src":"/images/65777139722_9.jpg","width":960,"height":1280}],"slug":"street-art-part-1-buenos-aires-has-a-lively-and","body":"<p><strong>Street Art - Part 1</strong></p>\n<p>Buenos Aires has a lively and active street art scene that covers the entire city.

Locally, people travel in mini-buses called combis. They are mostly beat-up large vans retrofitted with rows of seats and handrails. The combis are everywhere and come by literally every 5 seconds so you never have to wait. They drive along major roads inside cities and inter-city, and are labeled with the names of the streets or places they pass. You can figure out the route if you know the place names. The driver does nothing but drive, which can be a harrowing task in Lima. Then there is the &ldquo;cobrador,&rdquo; or helper who hangs his body out through the door continuously yelling out names of places. He calls out rapidly like an auctioneer repeating the names of streets in an ever-evolving cadence as the combi drives along its route. I think even if you&rsquo;re blind you will know exactly where you are based on the progression of the cobrador&rsquo;s call.</p>\n<p>So when you see or hear them call out the route you want, you wave, the combi slows down,and the cobrador opens the door for you, never breaking cadence. You jump in, literally - sometimes they barely stop! Once inside, you pay your fare to the cobrador, most often 35 cents, and when you want to get off you just say so, and the driver slows enough for you to jump out.</p>\n<p>People say the combi drivers drive unsafely. In my experience the combis drive aggressively Â in accordance with Lima&rsquo;s chaotic streets, yet we&rsquo;ve had taxi drivers that were even crazier. And a combi is bigger than a taxi, and you&rsquo;re surrounded by squishy people. And from a pedestrian point of view, combis are safer because they are more predictable. We&rsquo;ve had more close calls with taxis and cars trying to run us over.</p>\n<p>Overall a good transportation system? We have benefitted from riding combis as they are convenient, efficient, and cheap. They are privately run and lack strict regulation; some vehicles have seen better days. Pollution, congestion, and safety are problems that shouldn&rsquo;t be overlooked, but we definitely got where we wanted to go without having to walk 15 minutes and then waiting 20 minutes for a bus or overpriced train that have fights breaking out in them (ahem, DC Metro.)</p>"},{"id":61580441294,"type":"photo","date":1379503860000.0,"tags":["peru","lima","food","pizza","korean bbq","sushi","chinese"],"zoom":5,"location":"Lima, Peru","photos":[{"src":"/images/61580441294_0.jpg","caption":"Naple's Pizza","width":3264,"height":2448},{"src":"/images/61580441294_1.jpg","caption":"I stuffed a whole siu mai in my mouth","width":2448,"height":3264},{"src":"/images/61580441294_2.jpg","caption":"sushi","width":2448,"height":3264},{"src":"/images/61580441294_3.jpg","caption":"korean bbq","width":3264,"height":2448},{"src":"/images/61580441294_4.jpg","caption":"korean bbq","width":3264,"height":2448},{"src":"/images/61580441294_5.jpg","caption":"korean bbq","width":3264,"height":2448},{"src":"/images/61580441294_6.jpg","caption":"papa johns","width":3264,"height":2448}],"slug":"eating-in-lima-lima-is-south-americas-foodie","body":"<p><strong>Eating in Lima</strong><br/><br/>Lima is South America&rsquo;s foodie heaven.<br/><br/>Peruvian food is one of our favorite cuisines in the world, but we are so over it after eating it for a month straight.

There are a multitude of Inca sites. We hired a private guide and driver for the day, which was well worth the money. We arrived at each site ahead of the tour bus crowds and didn&rsquo;t have to wait around for slow people!<br/><br/><strong>Animals</strong><br/>We took a stop at an animal rescue center and got to see animals! Of course there were llamas and alpacas, and a skinny relative called the vicuÃ±a, which runs wild in the Andes. It is featured on the Peruvian flag. The vicuÃ±a purportedly produces the softest wool in the world, albeit slowly, and due to their undomesticated nature are highly susceptible to poaching. A vicuÃ±a wool scarf can cost over $1500 USD. Also featured in the rescue center were some massive Andean condors, a multitude of birds, wild cats, and other random animals.<br/><br/>At the next stop we were given a large bouquet of grass, instructed to hold it tightly, and walk through the llama/alpaca enclosure. Suddenly hungry camelids were all up in my face! They knew what&rsquo;s up. Yeah it was touristy but it was fun!<br/><br/><strong>Pisac</strong><br/>We visited the town of Pisac for the local market and some Inca ruins. At the market we helped Meredith bargain for an alpaca wool blanket, for which according to the tour guide, we got a fair price. Haggling is so much work! The Inca ruins at Pisac were nice examples of agricultural terracing. It took some effort to climb up the stairs to the residential areas, as we were still acclimatizing to the elevation.<br/><br/><strong>Guinea Pig Lunch</strong><br/>Lunch was cuy al palo, or guinea pig on a stick! We had asked our guide to take us to eat guinea pig, the way the locals like it. And this is why we loved having a private tour- we stopped in a small town known for its roadside stands with local women roasting skewered guinea pigs over charcoal. Â Seated at a plastic table on plastic chairs like the locals, we chowed down on a crispy little animal stuffed with local herbs! The skin was crispy, somewhat like roasted pork skin, but the meat is difficult to describe. I can&rsquo;t compare it to anything familiar, maybe pork, but not chicken, texture like duck, somewhat stringy. Not bad, and I would like to try eating it again. But one is quite small, divided between Peter, Meredith, and me. Next time I want my own! They say on your birthday, you get to eat a whole cuy.<br/><br/><strong>Ollantaytambo &amp; Chinchero</strong><br/>Another site we visited was Ollantaytambo, a settlement for wealthy Incas and priests built on the mountain featuring terraces, a temple, and extensive irrigation. There was a lot of fine stonework (the best stonework was for the wealthy and the religious, naturally.) Ollantaytambo is the starting point of the classic 4-day Inca trail to Machu Picchu, so we would be back in a few days.<br/><br/>We also visited Chinchero, a village high on a agricultural plain above the sacred valley which featured great Inca terraces and an old Catholic church built upon the Inca foundations.</p>"},{"id":60352246456,"type":"photo","date":1378380656000.0,"tags":["peru","cusco","inca"],"zoom":5,"location":"Cusco, Peru","photos":[{"src":"/images/60352246456_0.jpg","caption":"inca stone work","width":1280,"height":852},{"src":"/images/60352246456_1.jpg","caption":"beautify colonial entry way","width":852,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/60352246456_2.jpg","caption":"beautify colonial entry way","width":960,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/60352246456_3.jpg","caption":"beautify colonial entry way","width":960,"height":1280},{"src":"/images/60352246456_4.jpg","caption":"Church built of top of the Inca's temple of the Sun, Qorikancha.","width":1280,"height":852},{"src":"/images/60352246456_5.jpg","caption":"12 sided inca stone","width":1280,"height":960},{"src":"/images/60352246456_6.jpg","caption":"massive stone walls of Saksaywaman","width":1280,"height":852}],"slug":"cusco-the-capital-city-of-the-inca-empire-for","body":"<p><strong>Cusco, The Capital City of the Inca Empire</strong></p>\n<p>For the Inca, Cusco was the center or navel of the world.

We stayed at the nearby beach town of Huanchaco, which was a quieter and more relaxed place than Trujillo.Â </p>\n<p><strong>The Moche Civilization: Huaca de la Luna</strong></p>\n<p>The Moche civilization spanned from 100 to 700 CE and populated the river valleys of the northern Peru coast. It was a society based on agriculture using complex irrigation systems, fishing, and was known for its elaborate ceramic work.</p>\n<p>The Moche built structures using mud brick, which was sufficient for the desert climate. However every 3-7 years the El NiÃ±o phenomenon brings unseasonable rains which damage the desert ecosystem in northern Peru. During El NiÃ±o, the local agriculture suffered, the coastal bounty was reduced, and the dry mud buildings of the Moche were damaged by rains. During these times, the Moche believed that the gods were angry with them, and developed a ritual human sacrifice to appease him. The temple, Huaca de la Luna, played an important role in these large sacrificial rituals.Â </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_changes_of_535%E2%80%93536\" target=\"_blank\">One of the theories</a> of the downfall of the Moche was that a super El NiÃ±o occurred around 536-594 CEÂ which lasted 30 years, eroding the Moche faith that sacrifices would dispel ruinous weather. The Moches began to abandon their faith and their temples, but continued to live in the region, eventually giving rise to the Chimu culture.</p>\n<p><strong>The ChimÃº Civilization: Chan Chan</strong></p>\n<p>The ChimÃº culture, which was a continuation of the Moche, dominated the northern Peru region from 850 to 1470 CE. Chan Chan was their capital city. Like the Moche, structures were built with mud bricks, which did not hold up well to time and rain. Much of the site we visited had been restored by archaeologists.Â </p>\n<p>In Chan Chan, there were massive rectangular palaces, or mini-cities surrounded by high walls with only one entrance. Each palace was built for one ruler, and when he died it became his tomb. The next ruler and all the inhabitants built a new palace to live in. Thus each palace was inhabited successively. As to be expected, the common folk lived outside of the palaces, separate from the elites.Â </p>\n<p>The Chimu were conquered by the Incas in 1470 by Tupac Yupanqui, only 50 years before the Spanish arrived.</p>"},{"id":57889597950,"type":"photo","date":1376152926000.0,"tags":["food","peruvian food","peru","huanchaco"],"zoom":5,"location":"Huanchaco, Peru","photos":[{"src":"/images/57889597950_0.jpg","width":962,"height":960}],"slug":"picarones-are-fresh-deep-fried-dough-rings","body":"<p>Picarones are fresh deep-fried dough rings drizzled in a spiced molasses syrup.

The Galapagos is a group of volcanic islands in the Pacific Ocean straddling the equator off the coast of Ecuador. The islands are special because they are relatively new volcanic islands, the ecology of which has evolved from barren lava rock without the influence of humans. Each island is slightly different and contains unique plants and animals. The observations Charles Darwin made of the islands during his visit in 1835 incited his theory of natural selection, and he went on to write <em>On the Origin of Species</em>.</p>\n<p>We spent 6 days on the Grand Odyssey Yacht. The boat did not disappoint! It was large and luxurious, and Peter got his coveted hot tub on deck. We got to know 14 other passengers from around the world, (USA, Canada, Texas, Germany, Hong Kong, Australia) and an indulgent crew.</p>\n<p>The cruise took us to the following islands: Isabela, Fernandina, Santiago, and San Cristobal, where we hiked, snorkeled, kayaked, shot animals (pictures), and tanned to a shade of golden brown. Peter used a lot of sunscreen; I used a lot of meclizine.Â </p>\n<p>The islands are covered in flowing ribbons of black lava rock and pristine beaches lined with mangroves.Â During our trip we saw marine iguanas, giant tortoises, sea turtles, penguins, sea lions, sharks, fish, a whale, and birds. The animals evolved without predators so they are not afraid of humans. You can walk right up to them. For example the blue-footed boobie bird lays eggs and raises chicks directly on the beach without building a nest. The sea lions in particular are intelligent and playful like doggies; it wasn&rsquo;t uncommon for them to swim circles around a person snorkeling!</p>\n<p>We have a ton of pictures from the islands and we will be posting a small selection on this blog. The rest of the pictures will be uploaded to Flickr but the internet is super slow here so it might be a while before the album is complete, we&rsquo;ll post the link when it&rsquo;s ready.</p>"},{"id":54015268808,"type":"photo","date":1372342851000.0,"tags":["santa cruz","galapagos / ecuador","ecuador","galapagos"],"zoom":5,"location":"Santa Cruz, Galapagos / Ecuador","photos":[{"src":"/images/54015268808_0.jpg","width":1280,"height":960},{"src":"/images/54015268808_1.jpg","width":1280,"height":960},{"src":"/images/54015268808_2.jpg","width":1280,"height":960},{"src":"/images/54015268808_3.jpg","width":1280,"height":960},{"src":"/images/54015268808_4.jpg","width":960,"height":1280}],"slug":"we-have-been-in-the-galapagos-for-2-days-on-the","body":"<p>We have been in the Galapagos for 2 days on the island of Santa Cruz.

This means the earth&rsquo;s northern hemisphere is tilted to the max towards the sun. For those at home in the north, it is your longest day, and the start of summer. For us on the equator the summer solstice simply meant that the sun has traveled the furthest north of the equator. This is mildly interesting, as we visited the actual equator line.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>On the Equator line there is an entertaining little museum called IntiÃ±an. We had an English speaking guide who taught us a little about some of the indigenous people of Ecuador, includingÂ shrunken heads, poison darts, and fish that swim up your penis. Then we we brought to the equator line where we observed some equatorial &ldquo;phenomena,&rdquo; including the infamous drain trick demonstrating the Coriolis effect. Does water drain clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counter clockwise in the southern hemisphere? When a sink was placed directly on the line, we saw the water drain directly down without swirling. When moved north of the equator line, the water drained in a clockwise rotation, and counter clockwise south of the line! It was quite entertaining, but a it&rsquo;s just simple gimmick you can find out about on the Internet.Â </div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Next we visited the historic Mitad del Â Mundo Monument, which marked the equator as calculated before the age of GPS. Using only instruments available at the time, early geographers calculated this line and a monument was placed there in 1939.

They are quite fashionable. The predominant women&rsquo;s outfit is tight jeans, layered tops, jacket, accessories, and sky high heels. Leggings are popular too. Hair is long and beautiful and makeup is a must. The makeup may get a little heavy and fashion a bit trashy, but it is obvious they take the time to care about their look. I appreciate this, as it makes people watching very fun.<br/><br/>So obviously we stick out as tourists, the Chinita-con-Gringo wearing T-shirts and comfy sandals. I packed several hiking pants but no mascara. I remind myself that whatever I own I have to carry, but I am tempted to buy a pair of jeggings and high heels. Pity me for a minute as I only have my hiking shoes and a pair of sandals. A girl&rsquo;s gotta have shoes.<br/><br/>The first day we walked from our neighborhood La Mariscal through a large, lovely park El Ejido to the historic old city center. The old city center is typical of the beautiful Spanish colonial streets seen throughout Latin America. We took a taxi back to our hostel for a few dollars. The second day we managed the bus-tram like a local downtown (easy) for 25 cents. Its like a trolley, but actually a bus that drives in its own separate lane and stops at limited stations. I think it&rsquo;s genius and cheap and wonder why we can&rsquo;t have this on Georgia Ave. already instead of waiting 10 years for fancy trolleys. Anyway, along the way Peter haggled me a watch from $12 to $8, although in retrospect the cheap Chinese plastic is probably worth less. By the third day we had taken a city bus back from visiting a hilltop park El Panecillo. Atop the hill was a giant statue of Virgin Mary and spectacular views of Quito.<br/><br/>Lunch today was boiled potatoes in broth with a large slab of gelatinous pork skin, for $1.50. It was what all the locals at the market were eating, and not bad, though rather bland. Actually most of the food in Quito has been rather bland. At first I was excited over a pile of fried pork on top of fried potatoes, rice and corn but it got boring very quickly. A lot of carbs here- it&rsquo;s possible to see potatoes y rice y plantains y corn, all on one plate! There&rsquo;s a popular thing called &ldquo;salchipapas,&rdquo; which is a platter of hot dogs and fries. I&rsquo;m in no hurry to try it. There is ceviche, however I prefer the Peruvian version.<br/><br/>Oh by the way no hablo espaÃ±ol. Peter knows a little and I can memorize words and blurt them out them randomly.
