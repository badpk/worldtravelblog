# World Travel Blog

I ported my travel blog from tumblr to reactjs.

1. Exported blog data from tumblr which included xml and blog images
2. Transformed xml to json with a ruby script
3. Used create-react-app to start my react project
4. Deployed app to s3 using static website hosting feature
5. Configured DNS to point to s3 for my domain
6. Added Cloudfront to cache website
