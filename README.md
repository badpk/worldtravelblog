# World Travel Blog

I don't have a lot of React experience but I wanted to demonstrate my eagerness to learn by taking a couple of days to port my old tumblr travel blog to reactjs.

Steps:
1. Exported blog data from tumblr which included xml and blog images
2. Transformed xml to json with a ruby script
3. Used create-react-app to start my react project
4. Deployed app to s3 using static website hosting feature
5. Configured DNS to point to Cloudfront for my domain
